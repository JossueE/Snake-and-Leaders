# Snake and Leaders
The Snake and Ladder game is a team project that aims to demonstrate learning object-oriented programming. The game has a board where players move through the board by rolling a die and advancing the number of squares indicated on the die. The goal is to reach the final square before the other players, avoiding snake squares that cause players to move backward and aiming for ladder squares that advance them quickly.

## Requirements

- You need a C++ development environment to compile and run the game.
- Make sure you have the standard C++ libraries installed.

## Running the Game

Follow these steps to run the game:

1. Open the provided source code in your C++ development environment.

2. Compile the code to create the executable.

3. Run the resulting program.

## Game Rules

The game implemented in the code follows the basic rules of the Snake and Ladder game. Here is a general overview of the rules:

- The game is played on a board with numbered squares.
- Players roll a die to move through the board.
- Some squares are "snakes" that make the player move backward, while others are "ladders" that quickly advance the player.
- The goal is to reach the final square before the other players.

## Gameplay Instructions

When you start the game, it is necessary to provide the values of tiles, snakes, ladders, penalty, reward, number of players. You will be prompted to select the type of gameplay, either automatic or manual. Depending on your choice, the game will advance automatically or require your intervention for each turn.
